# AmericanDadEpisodeFixer
Small utility for a friend who wanted to organize his american dad episodes for Plex, the code is far from pretty but does the job quick and dirty.


## Instructions
Compile it or download the binary from the releases tab.

Call it with like `AmericanDadEpisodeFixer C:\Series\AmericanDad\` or put it in your series root (`C:\Series\AmericanDad\`) and run it without any arguments and it will move your episodes around to match what Plex expects. Can optionally be called with `-q` or `--quiet` to supress all output and interaction.
