# AmericanDadEpisodeFixer
Small utility for a friend who wanted to organize his american dad episodes for Plex, the code is far from pretty but does the job quick and dirty.

Compile it, call it with like "AmericanDadEpisodeFixer C:\Series\AmericanDad\" and it will move your episodes around to match what Plex excpets.
